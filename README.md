# Null To Visibility Converter C++/WinRT
Gets or sets the visibility of a UIElement. Based on [Xaml-Controls-Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/blob/master/XamlControlsGallery), 
I tried to port the [**NullToVisibilityConverter.cs**](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/blob/master/XamlControlsGallery/Common/NullToVisibilityConverter.cs) to **C++/WinRT**. I just started learning and my understanding could be wrong.
